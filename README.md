# LegaEase

I have completed the Full Stack development of LegaEase, where ordinary users can log in/sign up, browse for lawyers, access legal definitions, and explore the judiciary system. The backend is powered by MySQL, while the frontend is built using HTML and CSS. Connectivity is managed through the XAMPP server.
